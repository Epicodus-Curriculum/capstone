## Daily Structure 

Though this class is self-guided, the computer science curriculum should take around two hours, leaving the other two hours for job searching with your pair. Generally, you will spend the morning working on your job search and the afternoon coding.

An advisor will be available to answer questions from 10am – 12pm and 1pm – 3pm via Discord. You will only be able to take part in the post-internship program if you have an _Alum_ role in Discord, which will allow you to see the _5 week post internship course_ category. This is where you will be able to communicate with others in the course. You are expected to be available on Discord during the 10am – 12pm and 1pm – 3pm time frame. If you'd prefer to set your own pace and schedule (which you're welcome to do!), then there's no reason for you to be in the class, and we'd request that you not disrupt the structure and accountability for the other participating students.

### Job Search Expectations

Each Monday – Thursday morning from 10am – 12pm, your goal is to submit two high-quality job applications, for a total of 8 job applications per week. At the end of each week, your advisor will check over your job tracker spreadsheet to help hold you accountable and keep you on track with building good habits in your job search.

Every job you apply for should have its own unique resume and cover letter to show employers that you're interested in them specifically. For this reason, you should not use any _Quick Apply_ feature to apply to jobs. Your advisors will be checking your applications to make sure that your resumes and cover letters are targeted towards job postings.

During the job search portion of class, we encourage you to work with your pair and apply to jobs together. Proofread each other's application materials before applying.

Share good job posting finds with each other! Support each other in the job hunt. Your fellow students are your first network of peers in tech. When one person gets a job, your network expands through them. When everyone succeeds after Epicodus, it only reflects better on you for having gone through the program.

Similarly to the time you spent applying to jobs during React, once you have written a resume and cover letter, send in your application to the employer!

Add the links for your resume and cover letter to your job tracking spreadsheet (make sure they are shared and visible to your advisor). Even though you’ve already submitted your applications, your advisor can give you feedback on your resumes and cover letters that you can use to make future applications even better. 

### Computer Science Curriculum Expectations

Each afternoon from 1pm – 3pm, you'll work on 1 – 3 computer science lessons. There are no independent project requirements on Friday nor will your code be reviewed by instructors. We strongly encourage you to continue pair programming during this time.

If you finish early, you can do the following:

* Build an application that uses the computer science concepts you learned that day.
* Practice whiteboarding the concepts you've learned that day with a pair.
* Work on improving your capstone project or any other post-Epicodus projects you are working on.
* Find another computer science area of focus that you'd like to work on and do some self-directed study. If you are pairing, make sure you and your pair agree on what you'll study.
* Review previous computer science curriculum as needed. Quiz your partner on key concepts. This will help you better absorb and remember concepts.
* Spend additional time on your job search.

If you don't finish all the computer science lessons in the two hour time frame, don't worry. It's more important to absorb and understand the concepts than to rush through them. Remember, you will not receive code reviews on this content. Everything you learn during this curriculum will enhance your skills, make you a better programmer, and give you more tools both to ace technical interviews and to build better, more efficient applications. If you fall behind on content or feel you need to move at a slower pace, that is fine. Just continue where you left off from the day before. You are welcome to spend additional time beyond the 1pm – 3pm time frame working on studying concepts, either with a pair or on your own.
