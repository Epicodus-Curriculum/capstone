A programming language needs to have the following:

* **Primitive expressions:** These are the building blocks of a language and include primitives such as numbers and strings.

* **Ability to combine things:** We then need the ability to actually combine these simple building blocks to make more complex elements (such as arrays and objects).

* **Abstraction:** "by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units."

Data and procedures â€” data is the stuff we want to manipulate, procedures are the way to manipulate it.

Recursion is useful for dealing with hierarchical, tree-like objects.
