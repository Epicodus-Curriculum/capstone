# Professional Development Plan - Archetypes


## Introduction


In this lesson, we hope to provide you with certain "Archetypes" that we believe are examples of noteworthy combinations of the skills listed in the previous lesson.


These Archetypes are not binding, nor are they all-encompassing of skills that might otherwise be left out.


However, once you get to crafting your Professional Development Plan itself, you are welcome to refer back to these Archetypes as inspiration for crafting your plan.


## Archetypes


There are a few Archetypes that are immediately recognizable within the world of Web Development, and several of the skills in the previous lesson can easily fall within any given category. But, before we assign skills to Archetypes, let's define each Archetype.


### Front-End Developer


A front-end developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application or website. They work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces that facilitate smooth navigation and optimal user experience.


Here are some skills that a Front-End Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:


* Accessible Design: You might ensure that [ARIA principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) are utilized in a page, or that your site passes the [WCAG standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
* [Wireframing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/wireframing.html#:~:text=A%20wireframe%20is%20a%20two,styling%2C%20color%2C%20or%20graphics.): You may need to present a Wireframe of a design to display user stories before beginning development. You may also be given a Wireframe from a design team to work off of when crafting the visuals of a page.
* Screen readers/aria labels: Like in Accessible Design, you might ensure that [ARIA principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) are utilized in a page.
* Responsive design/media queries: Responsive design involves making your application work and perform well on various devices, as well as screen sizes. Most likely by using [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).
* Mobile-focused design: Also known as "Mobile-First" design, which means you start your design process with the smallest screen first, then work upwards.
* UI/UX: Following best practice for UI and UX is a large component of front-end development. Many of these best practices can be found around the web, such as at [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)
* [Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) rendering vs elements: Canvas is the best practice approach to rendering complicated or numerous elements that are specifically designed for display. Instead of using hundreds of `<div>` elements to create visual elements.
* Modern staples (Next.js, typescript): Some tools are now becoming the "hot new item" in the development world. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework that improves upon the vanilla React product, and Typescript is a strongly typed language that otherwise is very similar to JavaScript.
* Additional JS or C# frameworks: Always explore other frameworks that might benefit you. What packages could be beneficial for a project? What frameworks - like Next.js - might solve a problem or create a better experience for you?
* Open source projects and/or hackathons: All developer Archetypes will benefit from participating in public events, meetups, hackathons, and contributing to open source projects. As a reminder, the [Epicodus Curriculum](https://github.com/orgs/epicodus-curriculum/repositories) is an open source project!
* Cross-platform software: Software that can work on multiple platforms, such as Web, Mobile, smart watches, or other smart devices is something a front-end developer might consider while designing an application.


### Back-End Developer


A back-end developer focuses on the server-side of web development, dealing with the logic, databases, server, and application. They are responsible for creating the underlying functionality and infrastructure of a web application or website. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js, and databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.


Here are some skills that a Back-End Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:


* Data analysis
* User data storage security/DB security
* SaaS (such as AWS): Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model in which software applications are hosted and provided to customers over the internet. As a developer, it's likely that you'll encounter using these services. For example, Epicodus uses AWS S3 buckets to store our images. 
* Content Management Systems
* Cloud Computing (AWS/Azure/Etc.)
* Containers (Docker/Kubernetes/Etc.)
* Operating Systems (both desktop and mobile)
* Computer Networks/Networking fundamentals
* Scripting
* Cloud Security
* DevOps
* IT Automation
* Python
* Source Control Management
* Cryptography
* Go
* Blockchain development




### Full-Stack/General Developer


A full-stack developer is proficient in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all aspects of web application development. They have the skills to handle server-side programming, client-side coding, and database management. Full-stack developers are versatile and can work on all layers of the development stack, from user interface design to server-side logic and database management.


Full-Stack development can also be seen as controversial, as companies have moved over to relying on one role for the responsibilities of two. However, being a "Jack of all trades" isn't a bad thing, especially if you are interested in both avenues of development.


In addition to the skills that are listed above for both Front-End and Back-End developers, here are some skills that a Full-Stack Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:


* Kotlin (for Android development)
* Swift (Especially for iOS. Very similar to C# syntax)
* Publishing/Hosting apps: Whether you've created an API in C#, or a portfolio using React, hosting a project is a good step to get your projects in the hands of others, and show you can complete a project from top to bottom.
* Data structures/Algorithms: As much as these concepts may not appear in Front-end only development, many interview questions will benefit from this knowledge.
* Freelance rates/pricing: Familiarizing yourself with the common practices of freelance development, as well as knowing how to charge interested parties, is something all developers can explore.




## Adjacent Roles


In this section, you'll find a continuation of the Archetypes that are outlined above. However, the roles listed below may not be directly applicable to Web Development skills that we've been learning. Instead, transferable skills - such as general programming knowledge, test driven development, or skills and experience you may have from before Epicodus - can be harnessed to pursue these roles.


### Adjacent Development Roles


- **Cybersecurity developer:** A cybersecurity developer specializes in creating and implementing security measures to protect computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. They develop software solutions, algorithms, and protocols to safeguard against unauthorized access, data breaches, malware, and other cyber attacks. Cybersecurity developers often work with encryption, authentication mechanisms, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.
- **Quality assurance developer:** A quality assurance (QA) developer is responsible for testing software applications to ensure they meet quality standards, functional requirements, and user expectations. They design and implement testing strategies, develop automated testing scripts, and conduct manual and automated tests to identify and report defects or bugs. QA developers work closely with software developers and stakeholders to improve software quality, performance, and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.


### Adjacent Non-Development Roles


These are roles in the tech industry that are closely related to development but do not involve coding or programming as the primary focus. Examples include:


- **Project Manager:** Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of projects, ensuring they are completed on time, within budget, and meet quality standards.
- **Product Manager**: Defines the vision, strategy, and roadmap for a product, working closely with cross-functional teams to bring the product to market and drive its success.
